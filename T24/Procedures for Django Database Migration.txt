Procedures for Django Database Migrations to MariaDB
Django provides a straightforward way to manage database migrations, including migrations to server-based relational databases like MariaDB. Here’s how it can be done:

Setup Django Project: Ensure your Django project is configured to use MariaDB. Update your settings.py to point to your MariaDB database, specifying the database name, user, password, host, and port if necessary.

Initial Migration: If you haven't already created migrations, run the following command to initialize Django’s database schema based on your models:

python manage.py makemigrations
Apply Migrations: To apply migrations and synchronize the database schema with your Django models, use the migrate command:


python manage.py migrate
This command creates necessary tables and relationships in your MariaDB database based on the migration files generated by Django.

Advanced Migration Operations: Django provides additional commands to manage migrations:

python manage.py showmigrations: Lists all migrations and their status.
python manage.py sqlmigrate <app_name> <migration_id>: Displays the SQL statements for a specific migration.
python manage.py migrate --fake <app_name> <migration_id>: Marks a migration as applied without running its SQL.
Version Control: It's essential to maintain version control of your migrations (migrations directory) along with your codebase. This ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

Troubleshooting: If issues arise during migrations, check Django’s logs for detailed error messages. Common issues include database connectivity problems, incorrect database settings, or conflicts in migration dependencies.

By following these procedures, you can effectively manage Django database migrations to MariaDB, ensuring your application's data schema evolves seamlessly with your codebase.
